Visualizing Models, Data, and Training with TensorBoard
==============================================

[Visualizing Models, Data, and Training with TensorBoard](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/tensorboard_tutorial.html)


In this tutorial, weâ€™ll learn how to:

- Read in data and with appropriate transforms (nearly identical to the prior tutorial).
- Set up TensorBoard.
- Write to TensorBoard.
- Inspect a model architecture using TensorBoard.
- Use TensorBoard to create interactive versions of the visualizations we created in last tutorial, with less code
