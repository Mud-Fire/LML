Training a classifier
==============================================
We will do the following steps in order:

1 Load and normalizing the CIFAR10 training and test datasets using torchvision
2 Define a Convolutional Neural Network
3 Define a loss function
4 Train the network on the training data
5 Test the network on the test data
