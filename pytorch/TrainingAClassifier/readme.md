Training a classifier
==============================================
We will do the following steps in order:

-[x]Load and normalizing the CIFAR10 training and test datasets using torchvision
-[x]Define a Convolutional Neural Network
-[x]Define a loss function
-[x]Train the network on the training data
-[x]Test the network on the test data
